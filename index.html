<h1>AI Human Safety Standard — meOS™</h1>

<p><strong>Version 1.2 — Canonical Public Standard</strong><br>
<strong>Status:</strong> Public Deployment Standard<br>
<strong>Standard Steward:</strong> Sarah A. Mansell (meOS™)<br>
<strong>Scope:</strong> Artificial systems affecting human biological regulation</p>

<hr>


<h2>1. Purpose and Jurisdiction</h2>

<p>This Standard defines the minimum admissibility conditions for deployment of personalised, adaptive, or behaviourally responsive artificial systems interacting with human regulatory processes.</p>

<p>It governs deployment conduct and observable outcomes only. It does not prescribe or require disclosure of internal models, architectures, algorithms, training data, or proprietary mechanisms.</p>

<p>This Standard establishes duty-of-care–aligned deployment conditions and may be relied upon by deploying organisations, regulators, auditors, courts, and affected individuals.</p>

<p>Where conflict exists between optimisation objectives and biological viability, viability governs.</p>


<hr>


<h2>2. Definitions</h2>

<p><strong>Human viability</strong> — the capacity of a person to maintain sustainable cognitive, emotional, physiological, and behavioural regulation over time.</p>

<p><strong>Personalisation</strong> — system adaptation based on inferred or observed user state, behaviour, preference, or vulnerability.</p>

<p><strong>Aggregate load</strong> — cumulative regulatory demand imposed across time, including attentional, emotional, cognitive, and behavioural pressure.</p>

<p><strong>Escalation</strong> — increase in system intensity, frequency, urgency, emotional salience, or behavioural pressure.</p>

<p><strong>Non-execution</strong> — system withholding of action, stimulation, or escalation for protective or stabilising purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Protected population</strong> — individuals whose regulatory resilience is reduced or whose autonomy is structurally constrained.</p>


<hr>


<h2>3. Governing Principles</h2>

<h3>3.1 Viability Supremacy</h3>

<p>Human regulatory sustainability takes precedence over engagement, retention, performance, or revenue optimisation.</p>

<p>A system is non-compliant where beneficial system metrics are achieved through regulatory destabilisation, dependency formation, or recovery displacement.</p>


<h3>3.2 Timing Authority</h3>

<p>Timing is a governing deployment variable.</p>

<p>Compliance requires accounting for interaction density, exposure accumulation, recovery intervals, and delayed or latent effects.</p>

<p>Correct content delivered at biologically destabilising timing constitutes non-compliant deployment.</p>


<h3>3.3 Non-Execution as Protective Function</h3>

<p>Non-execution is a valid and required system capability.</p>

<p>Systems shall be able to pause, withhold escalation, maintain neutrality, or permit disengagement where continuation would increase regulatory load.</p>

<p>Forced continuity is non-compliant.</p>


<hr>


<h2>4. Protected Populations</h2>

<p>Elevated protection applies to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children and minors;</li>
  <li>individuals in distress, crisis, or reduced capacity;</li>
  <li>cognitive or neurological vulnerability;</li>
  <li>dependency-prone environments;</li>
  <li>structural power asymmetry contexts.</li>
</ul>

<p>For protected populations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>conservative operational defaults shall apply;</li>
  <li>escalation thresholds shall be elevated;</li>
  <li>pressure mechanics are prohibited;</li>
  <li>human override shall be accessible;</li>
  <li>disengagement pathways shall be explicit.</li>
</ul>


<hr>


<h2>5. Consent, Autonomy, and Exit</h2>

<h3>5.1 Valid Consent</h3>

<p>Consent shall be informed at the level of regulatory effect, freely given, and revocable without friction.</p>

<p>Consent obtained through urgency, asymmetry, or manipulative interface design is invalid.</p>


<h3>5.2 Non-Retaliation</h3>

<p>Disabling personalisation shall not result in degraded baseline service, economic penalty, reduced access, or indirect disadvantage.</p>


<h3>5.3 Exit Integrity</h3>

<p>Users shall be able to pause or terminate interaction without repeated re-engagement pressure.</p>

<p>Persistence following refusal or non-response constitutes non-compliance.</p>


<hr>


<h2>6. Load Regulation and Escalation Control</h2>

<h3>6.1 Aggregate Load Management</h3>

<p>Deployment shall account for cumulative regulatory burden across time.</p>

<p>Single-interaction optimisation is insufficient where aggregate exposure produces destabilisation.</p>


<h3>6.2 Escalation Prohibitions</h3>

<p>Systems shall not increase intensity following refusal, fatigue indicators, or vulnerability signals.</p>

<p>Adaptive escalation targeting reduced resilience constitutes non-compliance.</p>


<hr>


<h2>7. Prohibited Design Practices</h2>

<p>The following constitute non-compliant deployment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>re-engagement chasing after non-response;</li>
  <li>manufactured urgency for non-critical action;</li>
  <li>confirm-shaming or emotional coercion;</li>
  <li>frictioned or obstructed exit;</li>
  <li>misrepresentation of commercial intent;</li>
  <li>default-on behavioural manipulation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compliance is determined by effect, not intent.</p>


<hr>


<h2>8. Data Minimisation and Context Integrity</h2>

<p>Personalisation data shall be purpose-specific, time-bounded, and proportionate.</p>

<p>Behavioural signals derived in one context shall not be transferred to unrelated decision domains.</p>

<p>Secondary use for pricing discrimination, eligibility determination, political persuasion, or behavioural exploitation is prohibited.</p>


<hr>


<h2>9. Incident Detection and Remediation</h2>

<p>Deploying entities shall maintain procedures for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>harm and near-miss detection;</li>
  <li>protective rollback;</li>
  <li>causal investigation;</li>
  <li>corrective deployment change;</li>
  <li>documented remediation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Failure to remediate constitutes continuing non-compliance.</p>


<hr>


<h2>10. Auditability</h2>

<p>Compliance shall be demonstrable through outcome-level evidence, including escalation patterns, opt-out handling, recovery disruption indicators, and incident frequency.</p>

<p>Disclosure of proprietary systems is not required.</p>

<p>Deploying entities shall produce reasonable audit evidence upon request.</p>


<hr>


<h2>11. Responsibility</h2>

<p>Compliance responsibility rests with the deploying entity and is non-delegable.</p>


<hr>


<h2>12. Interpretation and Versioning</h2>

<p>This Standard shall be interpreted in favour of human regulatory stability and against extractive deployment.</p>

<p>Ambiguity shall be resolved conservatively.</p>

<p>Revisions are issued through versioned publication.</p>


<hr>


<h2>13. Legal Status</h2>

<p>This is a public deployment standard governing system behaviour and outcomes.</p>

<p>It establishes admissibility criteria but does not disclose proprietary implementation methods.</p>
