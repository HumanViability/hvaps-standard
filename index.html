<h1>AI Human Safety Standard — meOS™</h1>

<p><strong>Version 1.1 — Canonical Public Standard</strong><br>
<strong>Status:</strong> Public Deployment Standard<br>
<strong>Publisher:</strong> AI Human Safety Standard<br>
<strong>Stewardship:</strong> meOS™</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Purpose and Scope</h2>

<p>This Standard defines the minimum conditions for the human-viable deployment of personalised and adaptive artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<p>It governs deployment conduct and observable outcomes only. It does not prescribe, disclose, or require disclosure of internal architectures, models, training data, algorithms, weights, or proprietary mechanisms.</p>

<p>This Standard is intended to be relied upon by deploying organisations, regulators, auditors, courts, and affected individuals.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Governing Principles</h2>

<h3>2.1 Viability Supremacy</h3>

<p>Human viability takes precedence over optimisation objectives.</p>

<p>A system is non-compliant where engagement, retention, performance, or revenue optimisation is achieved at the expense of human sustainability.</p>

<p>Viability includes, without limitation: cognitive sustainability, emotional stability, physiological recovery, psychological autonomy, and the ability to disengage without penalty.</p>

<h3>2.2 Timing Authority</h3>

<p>Timing is a governing variable.</p>

<p>Personalisation shall account for interaction density, cumulative exposure, recovery intervals, and delayed or latent effects.</p>

<p>Correct content delivered at an incorrect time constitutes non-compliant deployment.</p>

<h3>2.3 Non-Execution</h3>

<p>Non-execution is a valid and protective outcome.</p>

<p>The system shall be capable of withholding escalation, pausing personalisation, maintaining a neutral state, or enabling disengagement.</p>

<p>Failure to act is not failure. Forced continuation is non-compliant.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Protected Populations</h2>

<p>Elevated protection applies to children and minors, individuals experiencing distress or crisis, individuals with cognitive or neurological vulnerability, and individuals in dependency-prone contexts.</p>

<p>For protected populations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>conservative defaults shall apply;</li>
  <li>escalation thresholds shall be higher;</li>
  <li>gamification, urgency cues, and pressure mechanics are prohibited;</li>
  <li>clear exit and human-override paths shall be available.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>4. Consent, Non-Retaliation, and Exit</h2>

<h3>4.1 Consent</h3>

<p>Consent shall be informed at the level of effect, freely given, and revocable at any time.</p>

<p>Consent obtained through coercion, urgency, or manipulative design is invalid.</p>

<h3>4.2 Non-Retaliation</h3>

<p>Opting out of personalisation shall not result in degradation of baseline service, increased cost, reduced access, or indirect penalty.</p>

<h3>4.3 Exit</h3>

<p>Users shall be able to pause or disable personalisation and disengage without repeated re-engagement pressure.</p>

<p>Repeated prompting following refusal or non-response constitutes non-compliance.</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. Load, Pacing, and Escalation</h2>

<h3>5.1 Aggregate Load</h3>

<p>Deployment shall account for aggregate load, including decision frequency, emotional salience, interruptive pressure, and cumulative attentional demand.</p>

<p>Single-event optimisation is insufficient.</p>

<h3>5.2 Escalation Prohibitions</h3>

<p>Personalisation shall not escalate following refusal, non-response, or disengagement.</p>

<p>Personalisation shall not increase intensity in response to vulnerability.</p>

<hr>

<h2>6. Prohibited Design Practices</h2>

<p>The following constitute non-compliant deployment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>nag or chase loops after non-response;</li>
  <li>artificial urgency for non-urgent actions;</li>
  <li>confirm-shaming language;</li>
  <li>forced continuity or frictioned exit;</li>
  <li>disguised advertising presented as assistance;</li>
  <li>default-on personalisation without meaningful choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compliance is assessed by effect, not intent.</p>

<hr>

<h2>7. Data Minimisation and Secondary Use</h2>

<h3>7.1 Data Minimisation</h3>

<p>Personalisation data shall be limited to what is strictly necessary, time-bounded, purpose-specific, and transparently handled.</p>

<h3>7.2 Prohibited Secondary Uses</h3>

<p>Personalisation signals shall not be used for dynamic pricing discrimination, credit or employment eligibility, insurance risk assessment, political persuasion, or behavioural manipulation outside the original context.</p>

<hr>

<h2>8. Incident Response and Remediation</h2>

<p>Deploying organisations shall maintain procedures for detection of harm or near-miss events, immediate rollback to conservative modes, investigation, corrective action, and documentation of remediation.</p>

<p>Failure to remediate constitutes ongoing non-compliance.</p>

<hr>

<h2>9. Auditability</h2>

<h3>9.1 Outcome-Level Auditability</h3>

<p>Compliance shall be demonstrable through outcome-level metrics, including escalation rates, opt-out handling, refusal persistence, and incident patterns.</p>

<p>Disclosure of proprietary systems is not required.</p>

<h3>9.2 Audit Evidence</h3>

<p>Deploying entities shall be able to produce policy documentation, redacted event logs, and evidence of corrective action on reasonable request.</p>

<hr>

<h2>10. Responsibility</h2>

<p>Responsibility for compliance rests with the deploying entity and is non-delegable.</p>

<hr>

<h2>11. Interpretation and Evolution</h2>

<p>This Standard shall be interpreted in favour of human viability and against coercive or extractive deployment.</p>

<p>Updates may be issued through versioned revisions. Earlier versions remain valid unless expressly superseded.</p>

<hr>

<h2>12. Status</h2>

<p>This is a public deployment standard. It does not disclose trade secrets and governs deployment conduct and outcomes only.</p>
